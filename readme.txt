Contact email form builder + real time analytics + online database to track and update leads through sales cycle

== Description ==

[Convertable](http://convertable.com) is the only plugin you will need to generate, track and manage leads with WordPress. In less than 5 minutes, you can build a contact form without having to know any HTML, get leads with real-time visitor tracking information (more detailed than Google Analytics) sent to your email, and update and manage your leads all within your WordPress dashboard.

Anyone can track the sources of conversions in Google Analytics. However, if you want to take the next step and identify the sources of the leads which convert into actual sales so you can determine how much revenue is generated by each marketing channel, then check out Convertable!

*     Create forms with our easy-to-use WYSIWYG form builder.
*     See source, keyword, hostname, geo-location, past visits, pages viewed, and time spent on site for each person who fills out your contact form.
*     Get an email as each form submission arrives.
*     Analyze real-time data with charts and tracking tools.
*     Make notes and track the status of each lead.
*     Connect pay-per-click, social media, banner advertising, and organic campaigns.
*     Not unnecessarily complex like typical CRM software.
